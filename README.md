The third assignment showcases practice with React and an expense tracker app. For this app the user adds expense title, expense amount, date of purchase, and expense category. 
The categories are either by default "-", or housing, grocery, transportation, clothes, or other. 
The inputs expense title, amount, and date, needs to be filled before the expense can be tracked and registered. 
The expense category does not need to be specified, where the "-" by default is perfectly fine. 

The design and the way that the expenses are shown, is inspired by the second assignment. 
However, all the tracked expenses are displayed no matter the specified category, and every expense contains their respective delete-buttons, so the user can delete expenses of their choice from the generated list.

The design of both the second and third assignment was not heavily prioritized. 
However, the main goal was that it works, and that the structure is clear and not confusing to the user. Local storage was not specified in this assignment description, and therefore was not prioritized.
